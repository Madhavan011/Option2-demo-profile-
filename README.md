This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my work and skills. The site includes the following pages:

Landing Page with hero section and call-to-action

About Me section with a short bio

Gallery with a JavaScript-enhanced image grid

Contact Page with a form

Navigation bar with accessibility enhancements

The goal of the site is to create a clean, responsive, and accessible user experience that works well across devices and screen sizes.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Site Hosting (if available)
Hosted link: https://your-username.github.io/portfolio
(Replace with your actual link if hosted)

ðŸ”¹ 3. W3 Validator Compliance âœ…
All HTML pages were tested using the W3C Validator. No errors were found.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Well-Styled with CSS ðŸŽ¨

flexbox and grid for layout

:focus, :hover states for accessibility and interactivity

@media for responsive breakpoints

Consistent margin/padding and hierarchy using rem and em units

Clean color scheme and spacing (no inline styles)
